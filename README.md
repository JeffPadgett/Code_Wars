# Code_Wars
Studies/Practice using the code wars website.

These are simply exercises that I have used from the website www.CodeWars.com

I enjoy the site because of its ranking system, and ease of access to challenging code test known as Kata's. It's basically a on the fly
way to keep skills relivient. 

These are not really meant to be run as an actual application. I just use these for personal references.
